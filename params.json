{"name":"SP7 Ritmare","tagline":"","body":"# [RITMARE Project](http://www.ritmare.it/en/)\r\n\r\n* RITMARE Flagship Project is one of the National Research Programmes funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research\r\n* RITMARE is the leading national marine research project for the period 2012-2016; the overall project budget amount to 250 million euros, co-funded by public and private resources\r\n* RITMARE is coordinated by the National Research Council and involves an integrated effort of most of the scientific community working on marine and maritime issues, as well as some major industrial groups\r\n* CNR entrusted the management of RITMARE to dr. Fabio Trincardi, PhD.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the RITMARE Flagship Project are:\r\n* will support training of a new generation of researchers, through the funding of innovative projects selected through call for proposal\r\n* will strengthen the strategic presence of Italian research in Europe and in the Mediterranean\r\n* will strengthen national oceanographic fleet, through the creation of a new research vessel with polar capacity\r\n* will promote the establishment of a permanent forum between researchers, decision makers and stakeholders in both the public and private sector, with the aim of fostering the integration and transfer of research results and thus place the knowledge as a reference starting point for strategies and management decisions\r\n\r\n# [SubProject 7](http://sp7.irea.cnr.it/) Interoperable Data Infrastructure for RITMARE\r\n\r\n\r\nRITMARE is a multidisciplinary and multi-sector project that will provide data, products and elaboration processes to be available to scientists and specific users; they will be delivered by means of an infrastructure, built on the basis of experiences of European projects, and of specifications and recommendations from both European Directives (INSPIRE, SPI, MFSD, WFD, Fishery Directive) and global initiatives (e.g. GEO/GEOSS).\r\n\r\nObjective of SP7 is to design and develop an infrastructure that allows coordinating and sharing observations, multidisciplinary data and information (and where possible also elaboration processes and models) produced and needed in the various subprojects, without forcing practices and enabling technologies already adopted by the participating scientific communities. It will be a Web environment based on interoperability, in order to maintain the heterogeneity of the project. The interoperable infrastructure is meant at sparing human and financial resources in the conversion to new models and formats, in view of preserving the important sources of past and historic information. In fact, it favours a wider, though controlled, sharing of data and information, but also of models, processes ad functions, thus fostering an optimal (re)use of resources, an improved productivity and creating more opportunities for science, technology and knowledge at large. Last but not least, the Web infrastructure decouples components of the information architecture that deliver data (and processes) with respect to those enabling user interaction: it encourages therefore to develop flexible Web environments, customised to the requirements of different usersâ€™ communities, tough reusing information sources to different purposes and uses.\r\n\r\n# [SP7-Ritmare GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SP7-Ritmare)\r\n\r\nCodes that are contained in this repositories concerns softwares developed for the implementation of Interoperable Data Infrastructure for RITMARE.\r\nAll softwares in this repositories are cover by GPL License.\r\nAll are free softwares: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\nAll softwares are distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\r\nSee the GNU General Public License for more details.\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with GeoNode.\r\nIf not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
